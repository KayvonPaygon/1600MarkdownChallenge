# Language Word Orders

In english, we use SVO word order. That is..

**SUBJECT:** The noun that does an action

**VERB** 
:The verb, the action that is taken place

**OBJECT**
:The noun that is *receiving/experiencing* the verb

### For example:

The cat ate the mouse!

<pre>
Subject | Cat

Verb    | ate

Object  | mouse
</pre>

 
But not *every* language is like this!

==In Fact==
*Most* aren't like this. Only 40.3% of the worlds languages are like this. The most common word order is actually SOV, or Subject-Object-Verb.

In an SOV language, that previous sentance would be...

### The cat the mouse ate

About 43.3% of the worlds languages are like this!
