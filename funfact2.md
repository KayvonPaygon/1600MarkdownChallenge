# Logographic Systems

Chinese is simple to read!!!

Just think about what something looks like!

This is the word **turtle**, or gui in Mandarin 

Doesn't it kinda look like one??

Now what about this?

This word is **person**, or ren in Mandarin

This time, you might need to stretch your imagination but its still close. It's kinda like someone walking

Now, the easiest one!

**CORRECT!!!!**

This means... country. Obvious right?

## So, obviously there's some difficulties

Remembering a couple would be no issue, but there are thousands of these. Aka, there are thousands of these that you need to memorize in order to just be able to read, let alone write. And worse yet, for the vast majority of them, there is no indication of pronunciation. So if you do not know a symbol by heart, you must draw it in order to look it up in a dictionary. Or if using a physical dictionary, guess the order in which the character's strokes, or lines, are drawn in order to find it.

However, theres some benefits you wouldn't expect. 

Take this text for example:

## في عام 2018، حدثت الكثير من الأحداث الهامة في العالم."

Unless you know arabic, you'll have no idea what this says. However, you may notice that subtle *2018* there. A number you can recognize and it is likely a *year*. So despite not knowing arabic, you can still dervie *some* meaning from this. 

**Now**

Imagine, that was entirely written in a logographic, or symbol based, system that you knew. Then, despite not knowing arabic at all, you would still be able to read and understand the meaning of the text. 

In the arabic text, you have no idea how to say the words 
> Two-thousand-and-eighteen

However, you sure know that it still means two-thousand-and-eighteen. 

## East Asian writing systems

For hundreds of years, the writing systems in east asia were largely influenced by china's writing system. So much so that they simply used the same characters for the same meanings. 

- In Japan to write the word person, you'd simply write **人**
- In Korea, you'd simple write **人**
- In Vietnam, you'd simply write **人**
- In Manchuria, you'd simply write **人**
- In Canton, you'd simply write **人**

Regardless of the fact that in Japan, you'd say "Hito"; or that in Korean, you'd say "Saram"; or that in Vietnam, you'd say "Nguoi"; or that in Manchuria, you'd say "niyalma"; or any other language that used this writing system. It all still means **person**. And despite not knowing eachothers languages, you could still read and understand it*

**Massive caveat being that many of these places created their own symbols for niche words, and the grammar also often didn't line up well (especially korean and japanese) which caused them to either fully drop the system (like in korea) or modify it so much that a lot of the meaning gets lost to someone who only knows the characters (like in japan)*
